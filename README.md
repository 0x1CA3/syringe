## Information
- How to use DLL/Code Injection functions:
  * Classic DLL Injection ```void Execute(int pid, wchar_t p_dll);```
  * DLL via Thread Hijacking ```void Execute(int pid, char *s);```
  * APC Code Injection ```void Execute(char *s, char *proc_name);```
	
- How to use Shellcode Exeuction functions:
  * Shellcode Execution (ASM) ```void Execute(void);```
  * Classic Shellcode Execution ```void Execute(char *code);```
  * Shellcode Execution via Windows Fibers ```void Execute(char *s);```
  * Regular Shellcode Execution (No Windows API) ```void Execute(char *shellcode);```
  * Shellcode Execution via RemoteThread ```void Execute(char *code);```
